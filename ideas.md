 - Idea 1 :  I may use a model that evaluates if the output is appropriate or not before displaying it to the user.

 - Idea 2:  Analytics tool that tells you what questions are asked and needs to be added to the database and some suggestions

- Idea 3 : 
     Embedd you model in vaious languages and detect what language the user input is using, and according search in the database
    * Find a unified way to translate the data into these different languages. Meaning that, the data entered by for example the
    Admissions team, lets say they inserted Q&As in english, there should be a way to convert them to arabic.

    * Another idea is using AI translation to translate from arabic to english and search in the english embeddings
