 - Idea 1 :  I may use a model that evaluates if the output is appropriate or not before displaying it to the user.

 - Idea 2:  Analytics tool that tells you what questions are asked and needs to be added to the database and some suggestions

- Idea 3 : 
     Embedd you model in vaious languages and detect what language the user input is using, and according search in the database
    * Find a unified way to translate the data into these different languages. Meaning that, the data entered by for example the
    Admissions team, lets say they inserted Q&As in english, there should be a way to convert them to arabic.

    * Another idea is using AI translation to translate from arabic to english and search in the english embeddings

- Hybrid Approach:
Intent Recognition: Use a classification model to recognize user intents. For well-defined intents, use the semantic search approach. For more open-ended queries, use the LLM to generate responses.
Contextual Understanding: Combine semantic search with contextual understanding. Use the LLM to understand the context of the conversation and select or modify answers accordingly.

- Conversational Memory:
Context Management: Implement a memory component that keeps track of the conversation context. This helps in providing more relevant answers and maintaining the flow of the conversation.

- Feedback Loop:
User Feedback: Allow users to provide feedback on the responses. Use this feedback to improve both the semantic search and the rephrasing quality.

- Dynamic Knowledge Base:
Real-Time Learning: Implement a mechanism for the chatbot to learn from new interactions. This can involve adding new question-answer pairs based on user queries and feedback.

- Future improvement: Maybe check the responses whether they are appropriate or not
- Check for user input, whether it's appropriate or not
